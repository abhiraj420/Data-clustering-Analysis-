# Data-Clustering Analysis: K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN
# Overview
This project explores different clustering algorithms, including K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN, using a real-world dataset.
The project covers:
* Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, removing outliers, and feature scaling)
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Implementing clustering algorithms using scikit-learn
* Parameter tuning for optimal cluster formation
* Cluster visualization and evaluation using metrics like Silhouette Score
# Dataset
The dataset contains features representing different characteristics of data points, which will be grouped into clusters using unsupervised learning techniques.

# Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
* Handle missing values
* Remove outliers
* Scale features (if necessary)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Use visualizations (scatter plots, histograms, pair plots) to identify potential clusters
* Analyze feature distributions
3. Clustering Algorithms Implementation
* K-Means Clustering
* Find the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
* Assign data points to clusters
* Hierarchical Clustering
* Experiment with different linkage criteria (single, complete, average)
* Generate a dendrogram for visualization
* DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)
* Tune epsilon (eps) and minPts for best clustering results
4. Cluster Analysis & Interpretation
* Analyze the clusters generated by each algorithm
* Compare results and provide insights
5. Visualization
* Scatter plots with color-coded clusters
* Dendrogram for Hierarchical Clustering
* Decision boundary visualization (if applicable)
6. Performance Evaluation
* Use Silhouette Score to evaluate cluster quality
* Compare clustering performance across different algorithms
